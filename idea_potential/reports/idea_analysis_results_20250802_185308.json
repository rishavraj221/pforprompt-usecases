I need to craft prompts that involve arithmetic-based questions within the economics domain—questions that a human with basic economic reasoning and arithmetic skills can solve correctly, but which large language models (LLMs) are likely to fail at.\n\nI’ve already drafted about 100 prompts, but most are too easy for AI agents—they solve them effortlessly.

I also implemented multi-query retrieval (3 question variations) and fused the results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion  inspired by what I learned from Lance Martin's youtube video on rag, I didn’t use...",
