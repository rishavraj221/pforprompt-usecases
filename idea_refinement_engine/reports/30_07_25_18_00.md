üöÄ IDEA VALIDATION REPORT
Idea: I built an app where users can share the problems with their prompt and llm hallucinations, it is at very initial stage and i want to engage it with the ai agents which will look for open source community forums and prepare the difficult questions for me to answer

Clarifications:
Q: Who exactly are the target users for this app?
A: My target users are primarily developers and AI enthusiasts who are actively engaging with language models and seeking solutions to common and obscure issues they encounter. This group values detailed, technical insight and often frequents forums like Stack Overflow or GitHub discussions.

Q: What specific problem are you solving with this app?
A: My app addresses the challenge that developers and AI enthusiasts face when they encounter issues with prompt engineering and AI hallucinations. It provides a platform where users can share their specific problems and receive curated questions that help them think through and solve these issues.

Q: How does your app curate and deliver questions to users?
A: In my app, I've implemented an intermediate level of AI-driven curation where questions from forums are first filtered by relevance to AI and programming challenges, using a combination of keyword extraction and topic modeling techniques. These questions are then ranked by their complexity and popularity before being delivered to users through a personalized feed based on their past interactions and preferences.

Q: What are the unique benefits of your app compared to other solutions like direct forum participation or existing Q&A platforms?
A: While my primary users are developers and AI enthusiasts, I am also looking to engage academic researchers and educators in the field of AI and machine learning. This expansion can foster a more scholarly community that contributes high-level insights into the platform.
