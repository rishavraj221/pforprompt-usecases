üöÄ IDEA VALIDATION REPORT
Idea: I built an app where users can share the problems with their prompt and llm hallucinations, it is at very initial stage and i want to engage it with the ai agents which will look for open source community forums and prepare the difficult questions for me to answer

Clarifications:
Q: What specific problem are you trying to solve with this app?
A: My app is designed to assist users who encounter perplexing or unclear interactions with AI language models, specifically in scenarios where the outputs can be classified as 'hallucinations' or misleading responses. It aims to create a platform where these experiences can be shared, discussed, and analyzed to improve understanding and handling of such AI behaviors.

Q: Who are the primary users of your app? Are they developers, AI researchers, general public, or another specific group?
A: My primary users are AI researchers and developers who are actively working with AI language models. These users have a technical background and a keen interest in understanding and resolving the issues related to AI hallucinations.

Q: How exactly will the AI agents enhance the functionality of your app?
A: The AI agents in my app will enhance its functionality by automatically scanning various open-source community forums to identify common and recurring issues related to AI hallucinations. They will gather these issues and present them in a structured format within the app. This will help users quickly find relevant problems and focus on developing solutions rather than spending time searching for information.

Q: What unique benefit does your app offer that users cannot get from existing platforms or solutions?
A: My app is designed to help AI developers and researchers identify, discuss, and resolve the 'hallucinations' or misleading outputs generated by AI language models. By focusing on this specific problem, it provides a centralized platform to understand and mitigate these issues effectively.
