```

## Specific Improvements Made

### 1. **Data Extraction Enhancement**

**Before:**
```python
def _calculate_problem_validation_score(self, reality_check: Dict, user_responses: List) -> int:
    score = 5  # Base score
    
    # Add points for user validation responses
    if user_responses:
        positive_responses = sum(1 for resp in user_responses if resp.get("sentiment") == "positive")
        score += min(3, positive_responses)
    
    # Add points for market evidence
    if reality_check and reality_check.get("market_evidence"):
        evidence_count = len(reality_check.get("market_evidence", []))
        score += min(2, evidence_count // 5)
    
    return min(10, score)
```

**After:**
```python
def _calculate_problem_validation_score(self, reality_check: Dict, user_responses: List) -> int:
    score = 3  # Base score
    
    # Add points for user validation responses
    if user_responses:
        positive_responses = sum(1 for resp in user_responses if resp.get("sentiment") == "positive")
        total_responses = len(user_responses)
        if total_responses > 0:
            positive_ratio = positive_responses / total_responses
            score += int(positive_ratio * 4)  # Up to 4 points for positive user feedback
    
    # Add points for market evidence
    if reality_check:
        # Check for forum mentions
        if reality_check.get("market_size_indicators"):
            forum_mentions = reality_check["market_size_indicators"].get("forum_mentions", 0)
            if forum_mentions > 20:
                score += 2
            elif forum_mentions > 10:
                score += 1
        
        # Check for web research findings
        if reality_check.get("web_research"):
            existing_solutions = len(reality_check["web_research"].get("existing_solutions", []))
            if existing_solutions > 0:  # Shows market exists
                score += 1
            
            forum_insights = len(reality_check["web_research"].get("forum_insights", []))
            if forum_insights > 0:
                score += 1
    
    return min(10, score)
```

### 2. **Real Competitive Analysis**

**Before:**
```python
competitive_analysis = ""
for i, competitor in enumerate(competitors[:3], 1):
    competitive_analysis += f"[Competitor {i}]|• [Strength 1]<br>• [Strength 2]|• [Weakness 1]<br>• [Weakness 2]|[Market leader/Niche player]\n"
```

**After:**
```python
competitive_analysis = ""
for i, competitor in enumerate(competitors[:3], 1):
    name = competitor.get("name", f"Competitor {i}")
    strengths = competitor.get("strengths", [])
    weaknesses = competitor.get("weaknesses", [])
    sentiment = competitor.get("user_sentiment", "neutral")
    
    competitive_analysis += f"{name}|• {chr(10).join(strengths[:2])}|• {chr(10).join(weaknesses[:2])}|{sentiment.title()}\n"

if not competitive_analysis:
    competitive_analysis = "No competitors identified|N/A|N/A|N/A\n"
```

### 3. **Dynamic Content Generation**

**Before:**
```python
return f"""Problem Severity: {'Critical' if evidence_count > 10 else 'Important' if evidence_count > 5 else 'Nice-to-have'}
Frequency: {'Daily' if evidence_count > 20 else 'Weekly' if evidence_count > 10 else 'Occasional'}"""
```

**After:**
```python
# Determine problem severity based on evidence
if evidence_count > 20:
    severity = "Critical"
    frequency = "Daily"
elif evidence_count > 10:
    severity = "Important"
    frequency = "Weekly"
else:
    severity = "Nice-to-have"
    frequency = "Occasional"

# Determine pain point intensity
if evidence_count > 15:
    intensity = "High"
elif evidence_count > 5:
    intensity = "Medium"
else:
    intensity = "Low"

return f"""Problem Severity: {severity}
Frequency: {frequency}
Pain Point Intensity: {intensity} - based on forum sentiment"""
```

### 4. **Evidence-Based Risk Assessment**

**Before:**
```python
return """[Risk 1 - e.g., "Market too small"]
Probability: High/Medium/Low
Impact: Critical/High/Medium
Mitigation: Specific action to validate/address"""
```

**After:**
```python
# Deal-breaker risks
deal_breaker_risks = []
if critique and critique.get("assumption_risks"):
    for risk in critique["assumption_risks"][:3]:
        parts = risk.split(":")
        if len(parts) >= 2:
            assumption = parts[0]
            risk_level = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else "Medium"
            deal_breaker_risks.append({
                "risk": assumption,
                "probability": risk_level,
                "impact": "Critical",
                "mitigation": "Specific action to validate/address"
            })

formatted = ""
for i, risk in enumerate(deal_breaker_risks, 1):
    formatted += f"""[Risk {i} - {risk['risk']}]
Probability: {risk['probability']}
Impact: {risk['impact']}
Mitigation: {risk['mitigation']}

"""
return formatted.strip()
```

### 5. **Realistic Execution Roadmap**

**Before:**
```python
return """Team: [Team composition needed]
Budget: $[X] total
Timeline: [X] weeks"""
```

**After:**
```python
# Determine timeline based on technical feasibility
technical_score = 5
if critique and critique.get("feasibility_scores"):
    technical_score = critique["feasibility_scores"].get("technical", 5)

if technical_score >= 8:
    mvp_timeline = "8-12 weeks"
    team_size = "1-2 developers"
elif technical_score >= 6:
    mvp_timeline = "12-16 weeks"
    team_size = "2-3 developers"
else:
    mvp_timeline = "16-24 weeks"
    team_size = "3-4 developers"

return f"""Team: {team_size}
Budget: $[X] total
Timeline: {mvp_timeline}"""
```

## Quality Improvements

### 1. **Mock Data Detection**
```python
# Check for mock data
mock_indicators = ["[X]", "[Action 1]", "[Specific task]", "[Cost estimate]", "[X]%", "$[X]"]
found_mock = []
for indicator in mock_indicators:
    if indicator in report:
        found_mock.append(indicator)

if found_mock:
    print(f"⚠️ Found mock data indicators: {found_mock}")
else:
    print("✅ No mock data found")
```

### 2. **Section Completeness**
```python
required_sections = [
    "🚀 IDEA VALIDATION REPORT",
    "📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY",
    "📈 Key Metrics Dashboard",
    "🎯 PROBLEM & SOLUTION ANALYSIS",
    "🏪 MARKET LANDSCAPE",
    "🔍 FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT",
    "⚠️ CRITICAL RISKS & MITIGATION",
    "📋 EXECUTION ROADMAP",
    "🔄 PIVOT OPTIONS",
    "📊 VALIDATION DATA SOURCES",
    "🎯 RECOMMENDATION & NEXT STEPS",
    "📎 APPENDICES"
]

missing_sections = []
for section in required_sections:
    if section not in report:
        missing_sections.append(section)

if missing_sections:
    print(f"⚠️ Missing sections: {missing_sections}")
else:
    print("✅ All required sections present")
```

## Results Summary
